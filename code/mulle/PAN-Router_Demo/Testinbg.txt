Test 1:
Start Router-Mulle, let in connect to SonyEricsson K810i and establish an Internet connection. Read the IP address and start a ping from a computer. Let the ping run for
one (1) hour.

Notes: if no traffic is flowing,  DHCP disconnects for some reason.

Test 2:
Start Router-Mulle, let in connect to SonyEricsson K810i and establish an Internet connection. Read the IP address and start a ping from a computer. 
Let the ping run for one hour.
Also at start, use a computer with Linux/Windows and have it connect to the router Mulle's PAN-NAP service. BNEP and DHCP should work. Then start a ping from the computer

Test 3:
Start Router-Mulle, let in connect to SonyEricsson K810i and establish an Internet connection. Use another PAN-U Mulle and have it connect to the router Mulle.
BNEP and DHCP must work fine. Then have the PAN-U Mulle use OLPv2 or httpc to transmit sensor data to the Internet.
